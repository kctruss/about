# About Me

## who I am:
I'm a former librarian who loves data and helping people find what they need, even if it's different from what they thought they were looking for.

I'm a tinkerer, a maker, a puzzle-solver, a finder of lost things and a fixer of broken things. 

## small details
- Mountain timezone
- When I can, I like to start my day early, work through lunch, and log off early to enjoy as much daylight as possible.
- full-stack engineer with a preference for back-end and db

## how I like to work:
- Blocks of uninterrupted ðŸŽ§  time when working on assigned tasks
- Collaborative pair programming/discussion when stuck on a problem
- Regular and consistent check-ins with team - synchronous or asynchronous


## how I communicate:
- Frequently
- Prefer Slack as much as possible
- I'm a "Clear all the red flags" type, so email will reach me quickly


## how I receive feedback:
- the positive:
	- Any ol' way is fine! 
- the negative:
	- Please do not surprise me in a meeting. 
	- When possible, privately in writing first with the option to follow up face-to-face.
	- Never publicly.


## how I learn:
- hands-on learner - fastest way for me to learn a new system is by debugging
- written is good, lists are better, visuals are best
- see one - do one - teach one: I like to share out what I learn, either by adding/adjusting documentation or by walking through it together


## things I love:
- learning
- solving puzzles
- data and finding patterns
- genre fiction (mystery, thriller, horror, sci-fi)
- yes, and - building off of each other to ideate exciting solutions
- mentorship mentality


## things I actively dislike:
- bullying
- gatekeeping
- unhelpful nitpicking 
- bringing umbrellas to a brainstorm
- folding laundry
